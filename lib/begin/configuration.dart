Adjectives are words that describe things. For example, we might say "La voiture rouge" which means "The red car."\n \n In French, adjectives come after the noun they are describing. This is different from English, where adjectives come before the noun. So, in French, we would say "La voiture rouge" instead of "The red car."\n \n Here is a table to help you understand some of the most common colors and their translations in French: ';

String myFooter =
    "When we want to describe something, we use adjectives to give more information about it. For example, we might say \"La grande maison blanche\" which means \"The big white house.\" The adjective \"grande\" (big) describes the noun \"maison\" (house), and the adjective \"blanche\" (white) describes the noun \"maison\" (house) too.In French, we also have something called gender. Every noun is either masculine or feminine. This affects the adjectives we use to describe them. For example, if we want to describe a car (voiture), we would say \"La voiture rouge\" if the car is feminine, but \"Le voiture rouge\" if the car is masculine.So, that's a little bit about how French people talk about colors and describing things. Remember, adjectives are your friend! Use them to make your French more descriptive and interesting.";

String profFooter =
    "As you can see, French job titles are similar to those in English, but there are some differences. For example, the word \"médecin\" translates to \"doctor\" in English, but in French it's used as a noun rather than a title.\nLearning how to pronounce French job titles correctly can be a challenge, but it can also be a rewarding experience. If you're interested in improving your French language skills, practicing the pronunciation of these job titles can be a great way to start.\n\nFrench people take pride in their professions, and they often use their job titles as a way to introduce themselves in social settings. However, it's important to note that they also value work-life balance and prioritize personal relationships and leisure time.\n\nI hope this information has given you a better understanding of how French people talk about professions.";
