    "French nouns are an important part of the French language. They are words that name people, animals, things, and ideas.In French, every noun has a gender, either masculine or feminine and it's important to use the correct article, \"le\" for masculine and \"la\" for feminine, when talking about them. For some nouns that begin with a vowel, the article \"l' \" is used instead to make it easier to say. This gender determines which article should be used before the noun. There are also singular and plural forms of both masculine and feminine nouns.\n\nHere is a table that shows some examples of French nouns and their corresponding articles:";

String nounFooter =
    "To determine the gender of a noun, there are some general rules you can follow. For example, most nouns ending in -e are feminine, while those ending in -age, -isme, and -ment are usually masculine. However, there are also many exceptions, and sometimes the gender of a noun simply needs to be memorized.\nIt's important to remember that the gender of a noun can't always be determined by its meaning, so it's helpful to learn the gender of a noun as you learn new vocabulary.\n\nKnowing French nouns is important if you want to speak and understand the French language. So, try to practice using French nouns in your everyday conversations and have fun learning a new language!";
